# Public Linux Configuration Files

Linux configuration files used on public servers. Now very simple.

# structure

- `userhome/`

    dot files like `.vimrc`, `.bashrc`.

- `etc/` and so on

    files in /etc and so on.

- `administration-scripts/`

    simple configuration scripts. Run at one's own risk.
